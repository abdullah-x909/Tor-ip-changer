## üîí About This Project

**Tor IP Rotator** is a lightweight, fully automated tool that safely rotates your Tor exit IP by sending the official `NEWNYM` signal via Tor's control port.  
It‚Äôs more secure than restarting the Tor service and avoids reusing circuits ‚Äî ideal for OSINT, penetration testing, or maintaining anonymity.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Fully automated installer for all tools
- ‚úÖ Sends secure `NEWNYM` signals without restarting Tor
- ‚úÖ Sets up cookie-based authentication (no password needed)
- ‚úÖ Prompts for user-defined IP change interval (e.g., every 5 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Installs a persistent **systemd service** to run on startup

## üõ† How It Works

1. Install and setup Tor
2. Configures Tor control port at 9051 with cookie authentication

4. Starts the script on system boot
5. Authenticates to Tor via control port
---


## Usage

Once installed, the service will automatically start and run in the background. Your IP address will be changed at the interval you specified during installation.

### Checking Status

To check if the service is running:
```bash
systemctl status change-tor-ip.service
```

## Uninstallation

To remove the IP Changer:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop change-tor-ip.service
sudo systemctl disable change-tor-ip.service
sudo systemctl stop tor
sudo systemctl disable tor
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/change-tor-ip.service
sudo rm /home/$USER/change_tor_ip.sh
```

## Security Note

This tool uses the Tor network to change your IP address. While Tor provides anonymity, please be aware that:
- Some websites may block Tor exit nodes
- Your connection speed may be affected
- Always use HTTPS connections for sensitive data
